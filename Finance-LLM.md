## Model Selection

- **Domain Expertise**: Select a model trained on a wide-ranging and diverse corpus of financial data, including financial reports, analyst reports, news articles, and other relevant sources. Models with strong domain expertise in finance are more likely to comprehend financial terminology, metrics, and concepts accurately.

- **Numerical Reasoning Capabilities**: Choose a model that demonstrates robust numerical reasoning capabilities, such as the ability to perform complex calculations, understand quantitative relationships, and interpret numerical patterns. These skills are essential for analyzing and interpreting financial data accurately and making strategic decisions.

- **Contextual Understanding**: Look for a model that can comprehend and reason about contextual factors, such as macroeconomic trends, regulatory environments, and competitive landscapes. Exposure to Named Entity Recognition tasks can be beneficial.

- **Interpretability and Explainability**: Select a model that offers interpretability and explainability features, allowing you to gain insights into the model's decision-making process and underlying reasoning.

- **Customization and Fine-tuning**: Utilize models that can be fine-tuned or customized with proprietary data and specialized knowledge in the domain, enhancing the model's performance in understanding the nuances of financial data.

- **Computational Resources**: Consider factors like model size (number of parameters), quantization techniques, and the tasks the model has been trained on, as they can influence computational resource requirements (processing power, memory capacity, and overall model complexity).

- **Security and Privacy**: When working with sensitive financial data, choose a model that meets strict security and privacy standards, and provides safeguards to prevent the leakage of training data (e.g., prompt injection prevention).

- **License**
    **Open-Source Models**:
    - Offer greater flexibility as model weights are accessible and output can be customized for downstream tasks.
    - Provide better privacy protection as the model and data remain under user's control.
    - However, reported evaluation metrics suggest a performance gap between open-source and proprietary models.
    - For certain tasks, zero-shot or few-shot learning may not yield optimal performance, requiring fine-tuning with labeled data, expertise, and computational resources.

In situations with labeled data, metrics like Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Hit Rate Analysis, and comparative analysis using BLEU and ROUGE scores are useful for quantifying the effectiveness of LLMs. In the absence of labeled data, the focus shifts to proxy metrics, user-centric evaluations, and innovative methods like sentiment analysis for consistency checks and automated readability tests.

The importance of semantic similarity and faithfulness in evaluating responses, along with the need for guideline adherence, highlights the significance of not just factual accuracy but also contextual and ethical alignment in LLM outputs.

## Deployment


### Estimating Hardware Requirements
To estimate the minimum number of GPUs required for inference, you can use the following rule of thumb:

`model_size_in_B * 2 * 1.25 / gpu_size_in_GB`

- For an 80B parameter model with 80GB GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA H100 or A100):
  - `80 * 2 * 1.25 / 80 = 3 GPUs` (minimum)
- This calculation assumes:
  - 2 bytes for storing model weights (1 byte if using quantization)
  - 25% additional memory for activations

While this provides a rough estimate, you may need more GPUs to achieve desired batch sizes and sequence lengths for optimal performance.

### Key Considerations

#### Inference Times
Ensuring low latency is crucial as end-users expect near real-time responses. Optimize the model, leverage efficient libraries/frameworks, and utilize hardware accelerators (GPUs, AI chips) to minimize inference times.

#### FinOps (Financial Operations)
- **Cost of hardware**: Determine the optimal CPU, GPU, memory configuration balancing performance and cost. Consider renting cloud instances or on-premises infrastructure.
- **Cost of scaling**: Plan for scaling resources up/down based on demand to avoid over/under-provisioning.
- **Cost of data transfer**: Factor in costs for ingesting inputs and egressing outputs if serving from the cloud.
- **Cost of monitoring and logging**: Implement monitoring and logging solutions, incurring additional costs but essential for maintenance and troubleshooting.

#### Scalability and High Availability
Deploy multiple instances and load balancing to handle concurrent requests based on expected load. Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes) to simplify scaling and high availability.

#### Security and Privacy
If dealing with sensitive financial data, ensure proper security measures (encryption, authentication, access control) and compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).

#### Monitoring and Logging
Implement robust monitoring and logging mechanisms to track system health, performance, and potential issues for troubleshooting and optimizing resource utilization.

#### Model Updates and Versioning
Establish processes for deploying updated model versions smoothly without disrupting the inference service (e.g., canary deployments, blue/green deployments, shadow traffic).

#### Inference Batching
To improve throughput and resource utilization, consider implementing inference batching where multiple requests are processed together in batches.
